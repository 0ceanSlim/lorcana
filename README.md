# Disney's Lorcana Python Tools

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:    
- Python installed   

You can download the latest version of Python from python.org.    
During installation, make sure to add Python to your system's PATH.       

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ceanslim/lorcana.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd lorcana
```

# Usage 

- The only funtionality at the moment is grabbing the pngs for all the cards in the game and saving them into a local folder. You can do that just by running the main script in the root of this directory

```bash
python main.py
```
This currently runs all the scripts in the src folder and grabs all current card images for the game.
